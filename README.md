A one-day intervention by Manuel Schmalstieg, in the frame of the course *[IDA114_Digital Design](https://www.hslu.ch/de-ch/design-kunst/studium/studienuebergreifende-module/ida-im-bachelor/modulangebot-2017/modulangebot-1-studienjahr/ida114-2017/) – Re-thinking the Web Standards*

* **Date:** Tuesday May 23, 2017 
* **Schedule:** 9h - 11h30 / 13h - 15h30

## Intro: 

It's the end of May. You are finishing the 3rd quarter of the project, with 3 weeks left until completion. Your website is now well on it's way, you have the fundamentals working, and are now concentrating on the details that matter most to you.

This session proposes to take a step back, and get a broader view on your project, with the purpose on making it future-proof. It's time to take a pause, and invest some time in documentation, code review and cleanup. By taking cue from best development practices, you will make your project more systematic, so it can scale, expand and embrace future changes.

## What we will do:

* Introduction into Design Principles
* Practical session: define your Design Principles, write your project's README.
* Introduction into Style Guides and Pattern Libraries
* Practical session: code documentation, define your patterns
