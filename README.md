## Intro: 

It's the end of May. You are finishing the 3rd quarter of the project, with 3 weeks left until completion. Your website is now well on it's way, you have the fundamentals working, and are concentrating on the individual details that matter most to you, the things that make your project unique.

This one-day work session proposes to take a step back, and get a broader view on your project, with the purpose on making it future-proof. You will apply some long-term thinking, and invest some time in documentation, code review and cleanup. By taking cue from best development practices, you will make your project more systematic, so it can scale, expand and embrace future changes.

## Ask any questions

Beyond the focus on **maintenance** and **scalability**, you are welcome to ask any questions you may have regarding your projects. Here are the areas where I am most likely able to help you:

* **CSS architecture:** I can help you find the best way to translate your visual ideas into functional CSS.
* **WordPress specifics:** any question regarding WordPress, custom themes and plugins.
* **Code versioning with Git:** I am teaching the use of versioning tools to design students, and can help you setting up your versioning workflow.
* **Webfonts and type design:** wondering how to customize and modify an openly licensed typeface? I will give you some pointers.
